### Not tables

# Almost table that's actually a heading

```````````````````````````````` example
foo
--
.
<h2>foo</h2>

<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">foo</th>

<th>qwe</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="right">a</td>
<td align="left">b</td>
<td align="center">c</td>
<td>d</td>
</tr>
<tr>

b | c | d | e | f
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
<th>baz</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables followed by other text

---|---
aaa|bbb

other text
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>aaa</td>
<td>bbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>other text</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
foo|bar
---|---
aaa|bbb

1. other text
2. other text
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>aaa</td>
<td>bbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol>
<li>other text</li>
<li>other text</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables with whitespace

```````````````````````````````` example
  foo|bar
  ---|---
  aaa|bbb
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>aaa</td>
<td>bbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| aaa | bbb |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>aaa</td>
<td>bbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
|	foo	|	bar	|
|	---	|	---	|
|	aaa	|	bbb	|
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>aaa</td>
<td>bbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables with preceding whitespace

A table should be parsed as long as the header row is not more than 3 columns
indented from the delimiter row.

```````````````````````````````` example
 foo|aaa
---|---
 
  foo|aaa
---|---

   foo|aaa
---|---

    foo|aaa
---|---
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<pre><code>foo|aaa
</code></pre>
<p>---|---</p>
````````````````````````````````

Similarly, a table should be parsed as long as the delimiter row is not more
than 3 columns indented from the header row.

```````````````````````````````` example
foo|aaa
 ---|---
 
foo|aaa
  ---|---

foo|aaa
   ---|---

foo|aaa
    ---|---
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>foo|aaa
---|---</p>
````````````````````````````````

The same applies to other rows of the table, except incorrect indentation will
only break the table and not prevent it from being generated at all.

```````````````````````````````` example
|foo|aaa|
 |---|---|
  |111|222|
   |333|444|
    |555|666|
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>aaa</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>222</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>333</td>
<td>444</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<pre><code>|555|666|
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

The whole table can also be slightly indented.

```````````````````````````````` example
 | A  | B  | C  |
 |:---|:---|:---|
 | 1  | Name | Toast |
 | 2  | Name | Server |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">A</th>
<th align="left">B</th>
<th align="left">C</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">1</td>
<td align="left">Name</td>
<td align="left">Toast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">2</td>
<td align="left">Name</td>
<td align="left">Server</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables with escaped pipes

```````````````````````````````` example
|\|oo|a\|a|
|---|---|
|ba\||\|bb|
|b\|z|cc\||
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>|oo</th>
<th>a|a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ba|</td>
<td>|bb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b|z</td>
<td>cc|</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
\|oo|a\|a\|
---|---
ba\||\|bb\|
b\|z|cc\|
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>|oo</th>
<th>a|a|</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ba|</td>
<td>|bb|</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b|z</td>
<td>cc|</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - The following section is copied from GitHub's tests for cmark available at
https://github.com/github/cmark/blob/master/test/extensions.txt

## Tables

Here's a well-formed table, doing everything it should.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| ghi | jkl |
| mno | pqr |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ghi</td>
<td>jkl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mno</td>
<td>pqr</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

We're going to mix up the table now; we'll demonstrate that inline formatting
works fine, but block elements don't.  You can also have empty cells, and the
textual alignment of the columns is shown to be irrelevant.

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1. Block elements inside cells don't work. | |
| But _**inline elements do**_. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>abc</em></th>
<th>セン</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Block elements inside cells don't work.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But <em><strong>inline elements do</strong></em>.</td>
<td>x</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Here we demonstrate some edge cases about what is and isn't a table.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Just enough table | to be considered table |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |

| ---- | --- |

|x|
|-|

| xyz |
| --- |
.
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Just enough table</th>
<th>to be considered table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>| ---- | --- |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>x</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>xyz</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

A "simpler" table, GFM style:

```````````````````````````````` example
abc | def
--- | ---
xyz | ghi
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>xyz</td>
<td>ghi</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

We are making the parser slighly more lax here. Here is a table with spaces at
the end:

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| this row has a space at the end | | 
| But _**inline elements do**_. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>abc</em></th>
<th>セン</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this row has a space at the end</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But <em><strong>inline elements do</strong></em>.</td>
<td>x</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Table alignment:

```````````````````````````````` example
aaa | bbb | ccc | ddd | eee
:-- | --- | :-: | --- | --:
fff | ggg | hhh | iii | jjj
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
<th align="center">ccc</th>
<th>ddd</th>
<th align="right">eee</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">fff</td>
<td>ggg</td>
<td align="center">hhh</td>
<td>iii</td>
<td align="right">jjj</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table cell count mismatches

The header and marker row must match.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |
.
<p>| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |</p>
````````````````````````````````

But any of the body rows can be shorter. Rows longer
than the header are truncated.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | ---
| x
| a | b
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>x</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded pipes

Tables with embedded pipes could be tricky.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| Escaped pipes are \|okay\|. | Like \| this. |
| Within `\|code\| is okay` too. |
| _**`c\|`**_ \| complex
| don't **\_reparse\_**
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Escaped pipes are |okay|.</td>
<td>Like | this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within <code>|code| is okay</code> too.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em><strong><code>c|</code></strong></em> | complex</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>don't <strong>_reparse_</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Oddly-formatted markers

This shouldn't assert.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
--- |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Escaping

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| \\ | `\\` |
| \\\\ | `\\\\` |
| \_ | `\_` |
| \| | `\|` |
| \a | `\a` |

\\ `\\`

\\\\ `\\\\`

\_ `\_`

\| `\|`

\a `\a`
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>\</td>
<td><code>\\</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\\</td>
<td><code>\\\\</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_</td>
<td><code>\_</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>|</td>
<td><code>|</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\a</td>
<td><code>\a</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>\ <code>\\</code></p>
<p>\\ <code>\\\\</code></p>
<p>_ <code>\_</code></p>
<p>| <code>\|</code></p>
<p>\a <code>\a</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded HTML

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
| --- |
| <strong>hello</strong> |
| ok <br> sure |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>hello</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ok <br> sure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Reference-style links

```````````````````````````````` example
Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][].

| Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][] in a table header. |
| --- |
| Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][] in a table row. |

[Freedom Planet 2]: http://www.freedomplanet2.com/
.
<p>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a> in a table header.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a> in a table row.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Empty cells

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d || e |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td></td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Interaction with emphasis

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
|***(a)***|
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em><strong>(a)</strong></em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table without space at the end

```````````````````````````````` example
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| :--: | :--: |
| r1c1 | r1c2 |
| r2c1 | r2c2 |
| r3c1 | r3c2 |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Header 1</th>
<th align="center">Header 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">r1c1</td>
<td align="center">r1c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r2c1</td>
<td align="center">r2c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r3c1</td>
<td align="center">r3c2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table with space at the end

```````````````````````````````` example
| Header 1 | Header 2 | 
| :--: | :--: | 
| r1c1 | r1c2 | 
| r2c1 | r2c2 | 
| r3c1 | r3c2 | 
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Header 1</th>
<th align="center">Header 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">r1c1</td>
<td align="center">r1c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r2c1</td>
<td align="center">r2c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r3c1</td>
<td align="center">r3c2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table with multiple spaces at the end

```````````````````````````````` example
| Header 1 | Header 2 |   
| :--: | :--: |
| r1c1 | r1c2 |         
| r2c1 | r2c2 |    
| r3c1 | r3c2 | 
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Header 1</th>
<th align="center">Header 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">r1c1</td>
<td align="center">r1c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r2c1</td>
<td align="center">r2c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">r3c1</td>
<td align="center">r3c2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables inside of blockquotes

This is a table in a block quote with each line starting with an angle bracket.

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
> | ccc | ddd |
> | eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ccc</td>
<td>ddd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eee</td>
<td>fff</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

Tables can be alongside paragraphs in block quotes.

```````````````````````````````` example
> This is the text at the start
>
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
> | ccc | ddd |
> | eee | fff |
>
> This is the text in the middle
>
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
> | ccc | ddd |
> | eee | fff |
>
> This is the text at the end
.
<blockquote>
<p>This is the text at the start</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ccc</td>
<td>ddd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eee</td>
<td>fff</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is the text in the middle</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ccc</td>
<td>ddd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eee</td>
<td>fff</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is the text at the end</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

At time of writing, GitHub requires that parts of the table in a quote need to
start with an angle bracket. Any part that isn't following an angle bracket
will be treated as plain text.

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
| --- | --- |
| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<p>| aaa | bbb |
| --- | --- |
| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
  | --- | --- |
  | ccc | ddd |
  | eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<p>| aaa | bbb |
| --- | --- |
| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

Once the first two rows are after angle brackets, the rest will be a plain text
outside of the block quote

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
  | ccc | ddd |
  | eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>| ccc | ddd |
| eee | fff |</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
> | aaa | bbb |
> | --- | --- |
> | ccc | ddd |
 | eee | fff |
.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ccc</td>
<td>ddd</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>| eee | fff |</p>
````````````````````````````````

### Tables inside of lists

Tables can be inside of lists as long as each row of the table is indented enough.

```````````````````````````````` example
- | aaa | bbb |
  | --- | --- |
  | ccc | ddd |
  | eee | fff |
.
<ul>
<li>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>aaa</th>

### Invalid table (MM-55972/MM-59809)

This table is invalid because of the space in the middle of the third column
of the second line of the table (`:----------------- --------------:`).

```````````````````````````````` example
| A | B | C | | |
| :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------- --------------: | :-----------: |:-----------: |
|D | E | F | G | H |
| | J | K | | |
.
<p>| A | B | C | | |
| <span data-emoji-name="--------------------------------" data-literal=":--------------------------------:" /> | <span data-emoji-name="----------------------------" data-literal=":----------------------------:" /> | :----------------- --------------: | <span data-emoji-name="-----------" data-literal=":-----------:" /> |<span data-emoji-name="-----------" data-literal=":-----------:" /> |
|D | E | F | G | H |
| | J | K | | |</p>
````````````````````````````````

This table is invalid because the last column of the delimiter row has no
dashes in it (`|  |`).

### Invalid table (MM-61148)

This obviously isn't a table, but the fix for the previous issue caused it to
generate an empty table.

```````````````````````````````` example
some text

|
.
<p>some text</p>
<p>|</p>
````````````````````````````````

### Table directly after a text in a list item (MM-46943)

```````````````````````````````` example
- See table below
  | First Header  | Second Header |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
  | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
- Second item
.
<ul>
<li>See table below
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>First Header</th>
<th>Second Header</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Content Cell</td>
<td>Content Cell</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Content Cell</td>
<td>Content Cell</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Second item</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
- See table below

  | First Header  | Second Header |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
  | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
- Second item
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>See table below</p>
<table>
