@hmhealey - Marked allows spaces between [link] and [1] for reference links
and escapes lone single quotes as in "Here's".

```````````````````````````````` example
Here's a [link][1] with an ampersand in the URL.

Here's a link with an amersand in the link text: [AT&T][2].

Here's an inline [link](/script?foo=1&bar=2).

@hmhealey - commonmark/GitHub disagree with marked that this shouldn't render as
an email link containing a < in the address.

```````````````````````````````` example
<noreply@example.com<mailto:noreply@example.com>>

### def_blocks

@hmhealey - marked treats the [2] as a link definition, but commonmark doesn't.

```````````````````````````````` example
> hello
> [1]: hello

* * *

> hello
[2]: hello
.
<blockquote>
<p>hello
[1]: hello</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>hello
[2]: hello</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - marked doesn't treat the [3] as a link definition, but commonmark does?

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
* [3]: hello
.
<ul>
<li>hello</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
[4]: hello
.
<ul>
<li>hello</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - marked treats the [1] as a link definition, but commonmark doesn't.

```````````````````````````````` example
> foo
> bar
[1]: foo
> bar
.
<blockquote>
<p>foo
bar
[1]: foo
bar</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

### double_link

```````````````````````````````` example
<p>Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>.</p>
.
<p>Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
Already linked: [http://example.com/](http://example.com/).
.
<p>Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - We don't handle this correctly. Our autolinking captures the asterisks
and the closing tag as part of the URL. The correct version should be:

<p>Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/"><strong>http://example.com/</strong></a>.</p>

```````````````````````````````` example
Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/">**http://example.com/**</a>.
.
<p>Already linked: <a href="http://example.com/">**<a href="http://example.com/**%3C/a%3E">http://example.com/**&lt;/a&gt;</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

### escaped_angles

@hmhealey - marked doesn't escape this.

```````````````````````````````` example
\>
.
<p>&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````

### gfm_breaks

@hmhealey - commonmark properly adds softbreaks between the lines here, but doesn't
render them in the HTML.

```````````````````````````````` example
Look at the
pretty line
breaks.
.
<p>Look at the
pretty line
breaks.</p>
````````````````````````````````

### gfm_code

@hmhealey - commonmark adds "language-js" as a CSS class instead of "lang-js". It also
doesn't HTML escape single quotes within code blocks like marked does

```````````````````````````````` example
``` js
var a = 'hello';
console.log(a + ' world');
```
.
<pre><code class="language-js">var a = 'hello';
console.log(a + ' world');
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
~~~bash
echo "hello, ${WORLD}"
~~~
.
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;hello, ${WORLD}&quot;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
```````longfence
Q: What do you call a tall person who sells stolen goods?
```````
.
<pre><code class="language-longfence">Q: What do you call a tall person who sells stolen goods?
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
~~~~~~~~~~  ManyTildes
A longfence!
~~~~~~~~~~
.
<pre><code class="language-ManyTildes">A longfence!
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
How about an empty code block?

```js
```
.
<p>How about an empty code block?</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"></code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
How about a code block with only an empty line?

```````````````````````````````` example
In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version
8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the
middle of a paragraph looked like a

### inline_html_simple

```````````````````````````````` example
Here's a simple block:

<div>
	foo
</div>
.
<p>Here's a simple block:</p>
<div>
	foo
</div>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
This should be a code block, though:

	<div>
		foo
	</div>
.
<p>This should be a code block, though:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
	foo

```````````````````````````````` example
As should this:

	<div>foo</div>
.
<p>As should this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;

.
<p>Now, nested:</p>
<div>
	<div>
		<div>
			foo

````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
This should just be an HTML comment:

<!-- Comment -->
.
<p>This should just be an HTML comment:</p>

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

<!-- foo -->   
.
<p>Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:</p>

### lazy_blockquotes

```````````````````````````````` example
> hi there
bud
.
<blockquote>
<p>hi there
bud</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

### links

@hmhealey - These links should all be sanitized out, but commonmark
doesn't do that by default

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL](javascript:alert)
.
<p><a href="javascript:alert">URL</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL](vbscript:alert)
.
<p><a href="vbscript:alert">URL</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL](javascript&colon;alert&#40;1&#41;)
.
<p><a href="javascript:alert(1)">URL</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL](javascript&#58;document;alert&#40;1&#41;)
.
<p><a href="javascript:document;alert(1)">URL</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL](data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K)
.
<p><a href="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K">URL</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

### links_inline_style

```````````````````````````````` example
Just a [URL](/url/).
.
<p>Just a <a href="/url/">URL</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL and title](/url/ "title").
.
<p><a href="/url/" title="title">URL and title</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL and title](/url/  "title preceded by two spaces").
.
<p><a href="/url/" title="title preceded by two spaces">URL and title</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - commonmark doesn't support this case, but Github does.

// ```````````````````````````````` example
// [URL and title](/url/	"title preceded by a tab").
// .
// <p><a href="/url/" title="title preceded by a tab">URL and title</a>.</p>
// ````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL and title](/url/ "title has spaces afterward"  ).
.
<p><a href="/url/" title="title has spaces afterward">URL and title</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - marked supports URLs with spaces, but commonmark and GitHub don't.

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL and title]( /url/has space ).
.
<p>[URL and title]( /url/has space ).</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[URL and title]( /url/has space/ "url has space and title").
.
<p>[URL and title]( /url/has space/ &quot;url has space and title&quot;).</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[Empty]().
.
<p><a href="">Empty</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

### links_reference_style

@hmhealey - commonmark and GitHub don't support spaces in between the two
parts of a reference link. It instead renders the second part as a link
on its own.

```````````````````````````````` example
Foo [bar] [1].

Foo [bar][1].

Foo [bar]
[1].

[1]: /url/  "Title"
.
<p>Foo [bar] <a href="/url/" title="Title">1</a>.</p>
<p>Foo <a href="/url/" title="Title">bar</a>.</p>
<p>Foo [bar]
<a href="/url/" title="Title">1</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
With [embedded [brackets]] [b].

With [embedded [brackets]][b].

[b]: /url/
.
<p>With [embedded [brackets]] <a href="/url/">b</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="/url/">embedded [brackets]</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
Indented [once][].

Indented [twice][].

Indented [thrice][].

Indented [four][] times.

 [once]: /url

  [twice]: /url

   [thrice]: /url

    [four]: /url
.
<p>Indented <a href="/url">once</a>.</p>
<p>Indented <a href="/url">twice</a>.</p>
<p>Indented <a href="/url">thrice</a>.</p>
<p>Indented [four][] times.</p>
<pre><code>[four]: /url
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[this] [this] should work

So should [this][this].

And [this] [].

And [this][].

And [this].

But not [that] [].

Nor [that][].

Nor [that].

[Something in brackets like [this][] should work]

[Same with [this].]

In this case, [this](/somethingelse/) points to something else.

Backslashing should suppress \[this] and [this\].

[this]: /foo
.
<p><a href="/foo">this</a> <a href="/foo">this</a> should work</p>
<p>So should <a href="/foo">this</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="/foo">this</a> [].</p>
<p>And <a href="/foo">this</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="/foo">this</a>.</p>
<p>But not [that] [].</p>
<p>Nor [that][].</p>
<p>Nor [that].</p>
<p>[Something in brackets like <a href="/foo">this</a> should work]</p>
<p>[Same with <a href="/foo">this</a>.]</p>
<p>In this case, <a href="/somethingelse/">this</a> points to something else.</p>
<p>Backslashing should suppress [this] and [this].</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
Here's one where the [link
breaks] across lines.

Here's another where the [link
breaks] across lines, but with a line-ending space.

[link breaks]: /url/
.
<p>Here's one where the <a href="/url/">link
breaks</a> across lines.</p>
<p>Here's another where the <a href="/url/">link
breaks</a> across lines, but with a line-ending space.</p>
````````````````````````````````

### links_shortcut_references

```````````````````````````````` example
This is the [simple case].

[simple case]: /simple
.
<p>This is the <a href="/simple">simple case</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
This one has a [line
break].

This one has a [line
break] with a line-ending space.

[line break]: /foo
.
<p>This one has a <a href="/foo">line
break</a>.</p>
<p>This one has a <a href="/foo">line
break</a> with a line-ending space.</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
[this] [that] and the [other]

[this]: /this
[that]: /that
[other]: /other
.
<p><a href="/this">this</a> <a href="/that">that</a> and the <a href="/other">other</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

### list_item_text

@hmhealey - This matches commonmark and GitHub, but not marked for where
the paragraph sits.

```````````````````````````````` example
  * item1

    * item2

  text
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>item1</p>
<ul>
<li>item2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>text</p>
````````````````````````````````

### literal_quotes_in_titles

@hmhealey - Neither commonmark nor GitHub support the behaviour marked's
behaviour on this.

```````````````````````````````` example
Foo [bar][].

Foo [bar](/url/ "Title with "quotes" inside").

  [bar]: /url/ "Title with "quotes" inside"
.
<p>Foo [bar][].</p>
<p>Foo [bar](/url/ &quot;Title with &quot;quotes&quot; inside&quot;).</p>
<p>[bar]: /url/ &quot;Title with &quot;quotes&quot; inside&quot;</p>
````````````````````````````````

### loose_lists

@hmhealey - marked treats individual items as loose while (ie. items
are wrapped in p tags) while commonmark and GitHub make every item loose
at the same time

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
  world

  how
  are
* you
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello
world</p>
<p>how
are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
  * world
    how

    are
    you

  * today
* hi
.
<ul>
<li>hello
<ul>
<li>
<p>world
how</p>
<p>are
you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>today</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hi</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - As a result, the following two examples render the same.

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello

* world
* hi
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hi</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
* world

* hi
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hi</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
* world

  how
* hi
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>world</p>
<p>how</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hi</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - As do these two

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
* world
* how

  are
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how</p>
<p>are</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
* hello
* world

* how

  are
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>hello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how</p>
<p>are</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

### main

@hmhealey - There's some inconsistencies here between marked and
commonmark/GitHub, but I'm not going to worry about listing them here.

```````````````````````````````` example
[test]: http://google.com/ "Google"

# A heading

Just a note, I've found that I can't test my markdown parser vs others.
For example, both markdown.js and showdown code blocks in lists wrong. They're
also completely [inconsistent][test] with regards to paragraphs in list items.

A link. Not anymore.

<aside>This will make me fail the test because
markdown.js doesnt acknowledge arbitrary html blocks =/</aside>
.

behaviour on these two.

```````````````````````````````` example
[link](example.com "title with "quotes"")
.
<p>[link](example.com &quot;title with &quot;quotes&quot;&quot;)</p>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - Seriously, who uses spaces in a URL

```````````````````````````````` example
[link with spaces](example.com/ spaces in the url "and a title")
.
<p>[link with spaces](example.com/ spaces in the url &quot;and a title&quot;)</p>

@hmhealey - We should support these properly eventually

```````````````````````````````` example
### Task Lists

- [ ] One
  - [ ] Subpoint one
  - Normal Bullet
- [ ] Two
- [x] Completed item
.
<h3>Task Lists</h3>

<li>[ ] Subpoint one</li>
<li>Normal Bullet</li>

<li>[ ] Two</li>
<li>[x] Completed item</li>
</ul>

```````````````````````````````` example
### Numbered Task Lists

1. [ ] One
2. [ ] Two
3. [x] Completed item
.
<h3>Numbered Task Lists</h3>
<ol>
<li>[ ] One</li>
<li>[ ] Two</li>
<li>[x] Completed item</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````

@hmhealey - This does not match default commonmark or GitHub
because the laziness causes "List B:" to be considered as part
of the first list item.

```````````````````````````````` example
### Multiple Lists

List A:
1. One
List B:
1. Two
.
<h3>Multiple Lists</h3>
<p>List A:</p>
<ol>
<li>One</li>
</ol>
<p>List B:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two</li>
</ol>
