## Tables

Here's a well-formed table, doing everything it should.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| ghi | jkl |
| mno | pqr |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ghi</td>
<td>jkl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mno</td>
<td>pqr</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

We're going to mix up the table now; we'll demonstrate that inline formatting
works fine, but block elements don't.  You can also have empty cells, and the
textual alignment of the columns is shown to be irrelevant.

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1. Block elements inside cells don't work. | |
| But _**inline elements do**_. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>abc</em></th>
<th>セン</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Block elements inside cells don't work.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But <em><strong>inline elements do</strong></em>.</td>
<td>x</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Here we demonstrate some edge cases about what is and isn't a table.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Just enough table | to be considered table |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |

| ---- | --- |

|x|
|-|

| xyz |
| --- |
.
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Just enough table</th>
<th>to be considered table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>| ---- | --- |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>x</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>xyz</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

A "simpler" table, GFM style:

```````````````````````````````` example
abc | def
--- | ---
xyz | ghi
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>xyz</td>
<td>ghi</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

We are making the parser slighly more lax here. Here is a table with spaces at
the end:

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| this row has a space at the end | | 
| But _**inline elements do**_. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>abc</em></th>
<th>セン</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this row has a space at the end</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But <em><strong>inline elements do</strong></em>.</td>
<td>x</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Table alignment:

```````````````````````````````` example
aaa | bbb | ccc | ddd | eee
:-- | --- | :-: | --- | --:
fff | ggg | hhh | iii | jjj
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">aaa</th>
<th>bbb</th>
<th align="center">ccc</th>
<th>ddd</th>
<th align="right">eee</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">fff</td>
<td>ggg</td>
<td align="center">hhh</td>
<td>iii</td>
<td align="right">jjj</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table cell count mismatches

The header and delimiter row must match.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |
.
<p>| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |</p>
````````````````````````````````

But any of the body rows can be shorter. Rows longer
than the header are truncated.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | ---
| x
| a | b
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>x</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded pipes

Tables with embedded pipes could be tricky.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| Escaped pipes are \|okay\|. | Like \| this. |
| Within `\|code\| is okay` too. |
| _**`c\|`**_ \| complex
| don't **\_reparse\_**
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Escaped pipes are |okay|.</td>
<td>Like | this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within <code>|code| is okay</code> too.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em><strong><code>c|</code></strong></em> | complex</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>don't <strong>_reparse_</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Oddly-formatted markers

This shouldn't assert.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
--- |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Escaping

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| \\ | `\\` |
| \\\\ | `\\\\` |
| \_ | `\_` |
| \| | `\|` |
| \a | `\a` |

\\ `\\`

\\\\ `\\\\`

\_ `\_`

\| `\|`

\a `\a`
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>\</td>
<td><code>\\</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\\</td>
<td><code>\\\\</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_</td>
<td><code>\_</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>|</td>
<td><code>|</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\a</td>
<td><code>\a</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>\ <code>\\</code></p>
<p>\\ <code>\\\\</code></p>
<p>_ <code>\_</code></p>
<p>| <code>\|</code></p>
<p>\a <code>\a</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded HTML

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
| --- |
| <strong>hello</strong> |
| ok <br> sure |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>hello</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ok <br> sure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Reference-style links

```````````````````````````````` example
Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][].

| Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][] in a table header. |
| --- |
| Here's a link to [Freedom Planet 2][] in a table row. |

[Freedom Planet 2]: http://www.freedomplanet2.com/
.
<p>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a> in a table header.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.freedomplanet2.com/">Freedom Planet 2</a> in a table row.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Sequential cells

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d || e |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td></td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### Interaction with emphasis

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
|***(a)***|
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em><strong>(a)</strong></em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

### a table can be recognised when separated from a paragraph of text without an empty line

@hmhealey We differ from GitHub here, so I've skipped this one for the time being.

```````````````````````````````` skipped
123
456
| a | b |
| ---| --- |
d | e
.
<p>123
456</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

## Interop

Autolink and tables.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| https://github.com www.github.com | http://pokemon.com |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a></td>
<td><a href="http://pokemon.com">http://pokemon.com</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````
